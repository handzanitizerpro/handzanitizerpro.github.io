  <li> 
   <p>Aloe Vera gel</p>

  </li>
  <p>Aloe vera gel is made from the aloe vera plant (seen above), we use it in our hand sanitizer to give it a thick but liquidy sense. Aloe vera gel is one of our main ingrediants in out hand sanitizer.</p>
  <li>
       <p>Essential Oils</p>

  </li>
     <p>Essential oils are used to make your sanitizer have a nice scent. Each sanitizer will come with one or two essential oils. The first one is tea tree oil. The tea tree oil is used to make the sanitizer. The second essential oil might be Eucalyptus, Lavendar, Lemon grass, Peppermint, Orange. Of course you might not always have a second essential oil, which in that cass your sanitizer will have no scent.</p> 
     
 <li>
     <p>Witch Hazel</p>

  </li>
  <p>A lot like the aloe vera gel, which is made off the aloe vera plant, witch hazel is also made off of the witch hazel plant (shown above)!Witch Hazel is used in our hand sanitizer to actually give the affect and kill bacteria and other germs, but it also prevents your hand sanitizer from being too thick.</p>
  <li
     <p>If not Witch Hazel, Rubbing Alcohol </p>

  </li>
<p>When we put rubbing alcohol into your sanitizer there isn't any witch hazel in it. We use it for the same purposes, however. It kills germs, and prevents your sanitizer from being too thick, as well.</p>

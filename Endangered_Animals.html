  <p>Have you heard of the Bengal Tiger? Or maybe the Snow Leopard? The Asiatic Lion? All of these are endangered animals. After reading this you will learn about the Bengal Tiger, the Snow Leopard, and the Asiatic Lion. As they are endangered, there are still things we can do to save them.</p> <br>
  <a name="Bengal Tiger"><p>The Bengal Tiger is an animal that is native to India. The Bengal Tiger species is endangered because their habitat is destroyed to create towns and buildings. As there are around only 2,000 Bengal Tigers today, people are trying to protect the species, by prohibiting tiger poaching. Some things you can do that would help save the Bengal Tiger are being a responsible tourist -- don’t litter in tiger habitats, and be careful about feeding zoo tigers, say no to buying animal skin clothing, and refuse to buy tiger tested products (Ex. Shampoos conditioners, perfumes, etc).</p><br>
  <a name="Snow Leopard"><p>Snow Leopards are also endangered animals, with only 4,000 of them standing in the wild today. Snow Leopards in Tibet and the Himalaya eat blue sheep (the native name is Bharal and no, they are not blue), Snow Leopards in the Russian mountain ranges eat ibex, and as ibex and blue sheep are their favorite foods, they will eat almost anything they catch, (Ex. wild sheep, goats, birds, etc). As we may think of Snow Leopards as man-eating mammals, the Snow Leopard has not been reported to attack humans, and in fact, they are one of the least aggressive big cats. As a result they are driven away from livestock, and they may not even defend themselves when threatened. The three main reasons they are endangered is, 1.) the origins of the cat are considered a traditional medicine, in some cultures, 2.) they are killed for their warm fur, and 3.) because of illegal poaching.<p><br>
  <a name="Asiatic Lion"><p>The Asiatic Lion (Panthera leo persica is the scientific name), which is commonly found in India’s Gir Forest, a  height of about 110 centimeters, and weights 110-190 kg. As you have read about other endangered animals above, the Asiatic Lions population grows. In 2010 their population was estimated to be 411. You may think that 411 Asiatic Lions are barely any. As we have respected the Lions habitat and groups such as WWF and ISEC, their population has grown to be 523 in 2015. They did this by taking away the Asiatic Lions main threat, which is Habitat Destruction.</p><br>
  <p>Now you know why about the Bengal Tiger, the Snow Leopard, and the Asiatic Lion and why they are endangered, but more importantly how to save them. They may be endangered but we can still save them.</p><br>
